# TextEditor


A basic text editor is a fundamental software application designed for creating, editing, and saving plain text documents. Typically featuring a straightforward user interface, it consists of a main editing area accompanied by menu options and toolbars. Users can perform essential text manipulation tasks such as typing, deleting, copying, and pasting within this interface.

The application supports basic file handling operations, including creating new documents, opening existing ones, saving the current document, and saving with a different name (Save As). Common keyboard shortcuts enhance user efficiency, and an undo/redo functionality allows users to revert and reapply changes.

Additional features may include a simple search and replace function, providing users with the ability to locate specific words or phrases within the document. A status bar at the bottom of the editor displays information like the current line and column number, while word wrap ensures long lines of text are visually wrapped within the editor window.

While more advanced text editors may include syntax highlighting for programming languages and other sophisticated functionalities, a basic text editor aims to provide users with a minimalist yet functional tool for handling text-based tasks. Such editors are commonly used for various purposes, including coding, note-taking, and general text editing.

The basic UI of the TextEditor is as follows :
